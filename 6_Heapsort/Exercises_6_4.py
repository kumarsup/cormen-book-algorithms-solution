6.4-1
Using Figure 6.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of HEAPSORT on the array
A D h5; 13; 2; 25; 7; 17; 20; 8; 4i.
6.4-2
Argue the correctness of HEAPSORT using the following loop invariant:
At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 2–5, the subarray
AŒ1 : : i is a max-heap containing the i smallest elements of AŒ1 : : n, and
the subarray AŒi C 1 : : n contains the n  i largest elements of AŒ1 : : n,
sorted.
6.4-3
What is the running time of HEAPSORT on an array A of length n that is already
sorted in increasing order? What about decreasing order?
6.4-4
Show that the worst-case running time of HEAPSORT is .n lg n/.
